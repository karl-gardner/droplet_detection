hello

Directions to Run Droplet Detection Models:

1) First create a folder in your google drive account called droplet_classification (This step is important in order to keep the directories in check)
2) Use this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Oo68HSdU-jzcBAEr0yeRuzuSxoprEP_D?usp=sharing to access the shared google drive folder
3) At the top there will be a dropdown arrow after the folder location (Shared with me > data_files): click on this dropdown arrow
4) Click on the "Add shortcut to Drive" button then navigate to inside the droplet_classification folder and click the blue "Add Shortcut" button.  This will add a shortcut to the shared google drive folder in your droplet_classification folder.
5) Open the yolov3 colab notebook from the colab badge provided, then click "Save a copy in Drive" under File > Save a copy in Drive.  Do the same for the provided yolov5 colab notebook.
6) This will save the two notebooks in the "Colab Notebooks" folder in your google drive.  Move these two notebooks to the droplet_classification folder and rename them yolov3.ipynb and yolov5.ipynb respectively in order for the directories to be correct in the colab notebook.  The final droplet_classification folder should look like this:<img width="720" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91646805/148874654-890a5d94-f9e9-4273-bcd8-318df44feca4.png">

7) You can now use both notebooks to perform more testing or contribute to the project.  You can find the code written for many of the figures in the final paper: DOI Website
