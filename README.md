hello

Directions to Run Droplet Detection Models:

1) First create a folder in your google drive account called droplet_detection (or whatever you would like)
2) use this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Oo68HSdU-jzcBAEr0yeRuzuSxoprEP_D?usp=sharing to access the shared google drive folder
3) At the top there will be a dropdown arrow after the folder location (Shared with me > data_files): click on this dropdown arrow
4) Click on the "Add shortcut to Drive" button then navigate to inside the droplet detection folder and click the blue "Add Shortcut" button.  This will add a shortcut to the shared google drive folder in your droplet_detection folder.  This step is important in order to keep the directories in check.
5)
